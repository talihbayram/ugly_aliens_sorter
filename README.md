Ugly Aliens Sorter
====================

Aliens Sorter (TM) processes a list of alien species, sorts them by planet of origin and writes in a planet-specific format to the output file.
It uses ```aliens.csv``` as input and produces ```planets.csv```

Aliens Sorter is a critical piece of company's infrastructure.
Originally written by a very junior Python developer, this code is seen by some as needing at least a minor refactoring. 

Please review and improve the code if you find it somehow lacking.

## IMPORTANT!
Remember it is a critical piece of infrastructure, and some other processes rely on the output being the same in the new version.
New planets and species are constantly being discovered in the galaxy.

Your solution should be a git archive containing your changes.
